### Project Description
[It registers lists of students who want to study specific subjects they have doubts in (e.g., mathematics, science, computer science) at a specified time and place. It helps users find suitable study partners by matching their subject preferences, study time, and location.]

### The Problem Statement
[The BrainMates Finder aims to connect students with peers who share similar subjects, study schedules, and optionally, locations, to facilitate collaborative learning. It helps users find suitable study partners based on their preferences and availability.]

### The Solution
[The project provides an easy-to-use platform for students to register their details, including their preferred subjects, available time, and location. It matches students based on these details, enabling them to connect and study together effectively. This makes the process of finding study buddies more efficient, organized, and enjoyable.]
